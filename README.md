# Linux Implant Fundamentals Course Repo

This is the template repository for the Linux Implant Fundamentals course. It contains a variety of template code, and the course content is also in the repo in [resources/course](resources/course/README.md). 

Welcome to the best (and only) Linux implant development training on the internet that was provably developed independent of criminal experience, knowledge of classified information, or trade secrets. 

Feel free to use this to teach yourself and your people things they ordinarily wouldn't be able to learn outside of a dark windowless room with NDAs.

If you have feedback, questions, or comments, hit me at d.m.devey@gmail.com or on Slack.

## How to Use This 

The course is contained in [resources/course](resources/course/README.md). Fork this repository and then add me as a collaborator so I can see your commits. 

Work through the material starting from the top of the README and submit your commits as you go (and as the course instructs).  I will check in on your commits and help you through the material. If you are having trouble, commit and get your repo up to date, send me a link to the commit version, and I will help you work through it.
