What is this
------------
SAdoor is a non listening remote shell/execution server.
The daemon listens for a set of predefined packets in 
order to establish a connection or run a command. 

There is a client available at http://cmn.listprojects.darklab.org, 
that makes the sending of the required packets and connection-establishing 
as transparant as possible.

The client also has alot of other features, like listening/connect mode
as well as dumping the required payload (append it to an image, and download
the image to secretly pass the command on to SAdoor) which makes it possible to
generate the required packets in real connections.

You are advised to read the plain text manuals in the ./doc 
directory for further explanations about the contents in this package.

Requirements
------------
o Libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org) 
o Root privileges


Installation
------------
Edit the Makefile in the daemon directory if you want 
to change the default root directory for installation (/),
or if your systype is not supported.

Then do a 'make <systype> && make install'.


Portability
-----------
This version has successfully been built using gcc(1) 
and tested on the following platforms:

OpenBSD 3.2, 3.0 (x86)
FreeBSD 5.0 (x86)
Linux 2.4.20 (Gentoo 1.4rc2, x86)
SunOS 5.7, 5.8 (Sparc)

Have fun!
