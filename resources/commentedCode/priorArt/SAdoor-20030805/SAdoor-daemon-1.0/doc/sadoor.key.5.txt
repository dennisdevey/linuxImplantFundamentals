SADOOR.KEY(5)                                       SADOOR.KEY(5)

NAME
       sadoor.key - sadoor(8) private key file.

DESCRIPTION
       The sadoor.key file contains the 448 bit Blowfish key used
       by the daemon for symmetric encryption of the data/command
       sent  in any command packet.  Sadoor will refuse to run if
       the key is not 448 bits.

       The default location is /etc/sadoor/sadoor.key, but it can
       be changed in sadoor.conf(5).

       To  generate  a new key file you are advised to use any of
       the random devices (preferable /dev/srandom on OpenBSD and
       /dev/random on Linux), like:
       dd if=/dev/srandom of=/etc/sadoor/sadoor.key bs=56 count=1

       If you don't have any random  device  (Solaris),  I  guess
       that  you have to come up with something "random" from the
       top of your head.
