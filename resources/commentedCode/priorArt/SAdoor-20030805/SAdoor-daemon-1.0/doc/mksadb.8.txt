MKSADB(8)                                               MKSADB(8)

NAME
       mksadb - Generate entry for sash(8) sadoor-database.

SYNOPSIS
       mksadb [-hv] [-c sadoor_config_file] [-o output_file]

DESCRIPTION
       mksadb  generates  a sadoor-database entry for sash(8) out
       of the current SAdoor configuration.  The  entry  contains
       all  information  needed by the daemon to run a command or
       establish a connection to the machine running SAdoor.

       The entry is written in plain text  (unencrypted)  to  the
       target  file  which  is  /etc/sadoor/sadoor.db  or the one
       specified in sadoor.conf(5) by default.

       The daemon then uses  sadbcat(1)  to  append/create/update
       the encrypted database containing machines running SAdoor.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -c config_file
