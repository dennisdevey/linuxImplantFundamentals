o Reduce the (to many) uland_calloc() calls.
  Well, when the connection is established, there are
  quite few of them, so I save this for later.

o Hide processes in /proc too.
  In this implementation, one could mount procfs to detect
  hidden processes (write a script that does a 'ps(1)' on each
  directory and rais an alarm if ps(1) fails).

o Hiding of promiscous mode (?)
  If we need this, we also need to make sure that
  promiscous mode should not be hidden if someone
  starts a "valid" sniffer, i.e. promiscous mode
  should be hidden only when SAdoor is using it
  to prevent detection.
