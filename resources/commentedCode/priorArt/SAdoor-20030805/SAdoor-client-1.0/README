What is this
------------
SAdoor is a non listening remote shell/execution server.
The daemon listens for a set of predefined packets in 
order to establish a connection or run a command.
This package contains a client to use for sending the
packets and the desired command.

You are advised to read the plain text manuals in the ./doc 
directory for further explanations about the contents in this package.

Installation
------------
Edit the Makefile in the client directory if you want 
to change the default root directory for installation (/),
or if your systype is not supported.

Then do a 'make <systype> && make install'.


Portability
-----------
This version has successfully been built using gcc(1) 
and tested on the following platforms:

OpenBSD 3.2, 3.0 (x86)
FreeBSD 5.0 (x86)
Linux 2.4.20 (Gentoo 1.4rc2, x86)

Have fun!
