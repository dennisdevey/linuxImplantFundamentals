SASH.CONF(5)                                         SASH.CONF(5)

NAME
       sash.conf - sash(1) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The sash.conf file makes it possible to set default values
       for target hosts running sadoor(8), that exists in a local
       database created with sadbcat(1).

       The  settings  is either for unused fields in the outgoing
       packets or sash(1) specific settings.  Numeric values  can
       be  set using base 2,8,16 or 10 (0b, 0, 0x respectively as
       prefix).  Everything after a '#' is interpreted as a  com-
       ment, and empty lines is ignored.

SYNTAX
       Each entry has the following syntax:
       IPv4addr'{'[options]'}'

       Where  IPv4addr is in "dotted decimal" and options has the
       syntax keyword = value';'.   The  optional  settings  with
       their corresponding keyword and expected value follows.

SASH OPTIONS
       baseaddr (dotted decimal)
          Local address to use for connections.  Default value is
          the address of hostname(1).

       sadb (file)
          SAdoor database file created with  sadbcat(1)  to  use.
          Default is ~/.sash/.sash.db.

       timeoutsec (unsigned 32 bit)
          Listen/Connect timeout in seconds. Default is 30.

       delayms (unsigned 32 bit)
          Delay between packets in milli seconds. Default is 1.

       escchar (unsigned 8 bit)
          Character to use as escape character. Default is ']'.

PACKET OPTIONS
       srcaddr (dotted decimal or random)
          Source IPv4 address.  Default is the value of baseaddr.

       iptos (unsigned 8 bit)
          Type of service, default is 0x00.

       ipid (unsigned 16 bit or random)
          IP identification number, default is random.

       ttl (unsigned 8 bit or random)
          Time To Live, default is 60. Random TTL is in the range
          30-255.

       addtottl (unsigned 8 bit)
          The  number to add to TTL, i.e. the number of hops away
          from target machine.  You need to  set  this  to  avoid
          error messages when sending packets that requires a TTL
          value.

       tcpack (unsigned 32 bit or random)
          TCP Acknowledge number, default is random.

       tcpseq (unsigned 32 bit or random)
          TCP sequence number, default is random.

       tcpflags (unsigned 6 bit or symbolic)
          TCP control flags, default is SYN ACK.

       tcpwin (unsigned 16 bit)
          TCP window size, default is 512.

       tcpsrcport (unsigned 16 or random)
          TCP source port, default is random.

       tcpdstport (unsigned 16 or random)
          TCP destination port, default is random.

       udpsrcport (unsigned 16 or random)
          UDP source port, default is random.

       udpdstport (unsigned 16 or random)
          UDP destination port, default is random.

       icmpid (unsigned 16 or random)
          ICMP identification number, default is random.

       icmpseq (unsigned 16 or random)
          ICMP sequence number, default is zero.

EXAMPLES
        # Example entry for target host 192.168.0.11.
        # The client host is 4 hops away from 192.168.0.11
        # according to the value of addtottl.
        192.168.0.11 {
            baseaddr = 192.168.0.1;
            sadb = /root/.sash/sensor1.sadb;
            timeoutsec = 5;
            delayms = 100;

            srcaddr = 207.46.249.222;
            ttl = 128;
            addtottl = 4;
            tcpseq = 0xdead;
            tcpflags = SYN ACK URG;
            tcpsrcport = 80;
        }
