# Sniffex to Portknocker
Using the sniffex.c file, implement a portknocking mechanism that checks for a single
knock to a pre-defined port and then calls a function which prints BANG.

1. What did you have to do to get that to work?
- I looked for the function where it converts the pcap to printable, noted how it got the port
- from there I checked if it was 22 and then called the function.
	
2. What do you see? Experiment to see how it works.
- I see the output of my function.


# Debugging
- I See that using strings and diff shows the hardcoded debugging strings i put in there as expected on the debug run.
