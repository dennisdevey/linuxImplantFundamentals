# Grugq Subversive LD
It's the Grugq again, you'll get used to seeing his name. Yeah, dude got around and wrote some serious shit. 

<https://grugq.github.io/docs/subversiveld.pdf>

His follow up is also very good. <https://grugq.github.io/docs/more_elf_buggery.txt>

Your assignment for this section is to comment his code for both papers and demonstrate that you have a very very general understanding of what is going on. One comment per function is generally enough. I promise, you'll enjoy it and you will learn a ridiculous amount if you spend more time, but it is brutally complicated.

When you are done, save the commented files into /resources/commentedCode and submit your commit.
