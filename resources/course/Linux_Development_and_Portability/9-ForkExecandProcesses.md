# ForkExec and Processes
Before you do this, go over this from one of my previous courses to get yourself into the mindset. <$@ASSIGNVIEWBYID*2382@$>

I really should make a nice demo lab for this, but for now, do this tutorial: <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-fork-exec/>. Spend a lot of time looking at the output of ps and understand what is going on here. 

For your assignment comment the code in here and submit the commit.
