# Better Practices
Alright, so you got the beginnings of your new implant compiling, but now it is time for reproducible builds, logging, and all manner of professionalizing ourselves!

In this APT we use style guides because we are professionals. Again, this course assumes you are writing Python and C, but no worries if you want to do this with another language, I just won't be as helpful.

These are the style guides we use in this APT. Don't read them now, but reference them as you go forward. 

* Python: <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>
* C/C++: <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>
* Other Languages: <https://google.github.io/styleguide/>

Next, we use Github.

You will be expected to push your commits as you go with appropriate names for the section you have completed, along with well explained notes. The vast majority of your assignments going forward will be links to your commits, so hopefully that helps you learn good development practices.

Finally, we aren't going to build pipeline stuff yet, but we will do reproducible builds by logging all config info and naming everything uniquely.
