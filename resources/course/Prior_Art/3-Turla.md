# Turla
Now if you spend some time googling around the search terms "port knock backdoor" and "cd00r" eventually you will come across this mention of Turla using a cd00r variant.

Now Turla is not small fish in Black sea, they are big time Russian APT. Kind of guys that get a bear named after them. And they've been around for fucking ever.

In fact, they are notable for having the sexiest C2 of all time, via hijacked satellite links. <https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/>

We've all gotta have our heros, y'know? (If anyone from Turla is reading this, I'd love some merch or we can do a jersey swap. Can't find a gift shop anywhere)

Does this mean that we can just get the cd00r backdoor running, change around a couple functions and BOOM we become an APT? 

Of course not! But lets go make that happen.

For this assignment submit your favorite Turla fact. Don't write too much, this is really just so I can keep track of your progress, I have plenty of assignments like this throughout the course. 

turla has many injected sites and currently, the largest number of injected sites is in Romania.
