# cd00r
Well before we go and try to build a linux backdoor that uses portknocking written in c, might as well go look for some prior art first! Even though that sounds pretty fancy, there's a chance that someone else has done it before! 

I like to think of myself as a real visionary, so I bet this has never been done and we are breaking new ground. 

As mentioned in the greetz, we're not breaking much new ground in this course. Looks like this was done before, umm... back in 2000! Great year for hacking, I was 5. Alright so maybe I'm not the genius hacker I thought I was, cd00r.c has been kicking around for a while. Let's go look for more information on this.

**(On the plus side, I don't feel bad at all teaching you how to write malware if someone already released the source code 20 years ago)**

This is a great resource and contains the code, but let's go find the original source..

Your first assignment is to take a copy of cd00r.c and comment it up so that you know exactly what is going on throughout the code. Commenting other people's code is an important first step in becoming an adult hacker, so let's get after it. When you are done, submit it here.
