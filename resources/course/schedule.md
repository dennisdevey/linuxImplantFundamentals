## Week 1:

* Day 1: Finish 'Prior Art', Understand cd00r and get it to compile. Continue to DevOps. 
* Day 2: Work as far through 'DevOps' as possible. 
* Day 3: Finish DevOps and do "Linux Development" and "Compilers" from the 'Development and Portability' section. 
   * I don't want you to do 'Development and Portability' all in a row, it is a bit brutal and technically dense. 
   * Once you have finished "Compilers", move on to the 'Backdoor Basics' section
 * Day 4: Complete as much of 'Backdoor Basics' as you can
  * We will be doing our first competition this afternoon and will introduce the competition format for future weeks

## Week 2:

* Day 1: Finish 'Backdoor Basics'
  * Once you have that done, we will go  back to "Architecture Portability" and get your implant to compile for 32 bit Linux. 

To be continued...
