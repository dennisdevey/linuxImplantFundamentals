# Course Description
This is a course that will guide you down the path of developing your own fully featured implant framework in C ([specifically Turla's Penguin](https://securelist.com/the-penquin-turla-2/67962/)) that uses a port knocking backdoor, along with a bunch of other real world techniques to teach the fundamentals of good Linux computer network operations development. You will write a web based C2 framework, all sorts of droppers, loaders, and shellcode runners, and get the valuable hands on experience that ordinarily you can only get in a SCIF or through a bunch of proxies from a poorly lit, un-ventilated room . The course also teaches anti-forensics, malware analysis, shellcode injection, anti-detection techniques, and rootkits. 

You will also spend a large amount of time commenting code other people have written so that you can lock down the concepts that make the magic happen. Think about it this way, do you think great authors just sat down one day and wrote a novel? No! First, they had to learn how to write. You're about their right now. Then, they needed to understand what great writing looks like. Personally I feel like if you want to learn you should spend about 50% of your time reading source code, 25% reading manuals, and the final 25% should be writing code. I don't do that to you and the breakdown winds up more like 50%+ code, so you're welcome. 

Code commenting and the grind aside, when you are done with this course you can tell your friends, family, and coworkers that you are an APT. That's worth something.

## Learning Objectives
This course is designed to help you get better at C and understand what goes into implant development and detection. It is written fairly tongue in cheek, and is not meant to be some sort of definitive guide, or even an above average guide. You have to do most of the work, I just help you along as you go. 

This is not a course that will teach you about APTs or threat intelligence. There are plenty of people you can pay large amounts of money that will teach you the secret is "spend too much time on Twitter" and "take venture capital so you have enough marketing spend to stand out from the people who give it away for free". You're welcome for that free knowledge.

### What Qualifies Me to Teach This
As an important note, I am not qualified to write a course on this subject (or I would go to jail). I wrote an implant framework for fun once so I turned it into a course because I like teaching. 

### Pre-Requisites: 
1. Decent knowledge of C, Python, and Linux, comfortable writing larger programs
   * Don't worry about being an expert, it's completely unnecessary
   * All the material in this course can be written in other languages like C++/C#/Go, I just won't be able to help as much. 
2. Able to confidently discuss and implement networking tasks 
3. Not be a criminal, nation-state hacker (for anyone outside of FVEY), or plan on being one anytime soon

## This Site
If you are new to [Hopper's Roppers](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/), we are a free site run by one dude that delivers pretty high quality security training. We've only been around for a year but have made a difference in a lot of student's lives.

Our flagship course is [Ropper's Computing Fundamentals](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/course.html), which is designed to give a beginner in the cyber security field the knowledge and skills required to be successful in the field. It teaches security fundamentals along with a strong technical foundation that students will build on for years to come.

I highly recommend you check that course out and send it to anyone you know who is looking to find a formalized path into this world. 

If you have wound up here and don't know how to setup a network, write a script, or know how computers work, [you should sign up here today]($@COURSEVIEWBYID*8@$). As cool as writing a rootkit sounds, there is so much more to learn that you'll have much more fun doing before this.
