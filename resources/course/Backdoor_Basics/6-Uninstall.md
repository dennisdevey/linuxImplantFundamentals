# Uninstall
We're professionals here, write a function that will uninstall your implant and remove the persistence method when you run it. We all gotta do cleanup sometimes, and it makes forensics a real pain in the ass. We'll get to in-memory only eventually, but not yet, for now we are writing to disc and deleting from disc like absolute chumps. 

I'm not going to make you do forensics on this yet and pull yourself off disc after uninstall, but I will eventually.
